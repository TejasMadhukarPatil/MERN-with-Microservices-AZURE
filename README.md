#  MERN with Microservices



For `helloService`, create `.env` file with the content:
```bash
PORT=3001
```

For `profileService`, create `.env` file with the content:
```bash
PORT=3002
MONGO_URL="specifyYourMongoURLHereWithDatabaseNameInTheEnd"

Finally install packages in both the services by running the command `npm install`.
